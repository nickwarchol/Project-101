            <strong>Hi, my name is Nick Warchol and this is my first semester at San Diego Global Knowledge University. I have a bit of experience in self-taught coding that I would study from Youtube, or Codecademy. Below are a few things about me and what I like to do.</strong>

               One of my favorite sports is ice hockey. When I was in highschool I played for the team for<br/> about two years. After school I found an adult league I participated in.

                 I was raised a military child and doing so I got to live overseas and experience<br/> lots of different cultures. Everyone in my family is military and I am blessed<br/> to be living in such an amazing country.

                A hobby of mine is also studying about cars, driving them, drifting them,<br/> and taking pictures with them. I love my car and it helps me get out of the<br/> house and want to go and travel all the beauties in San Diego.</li>
